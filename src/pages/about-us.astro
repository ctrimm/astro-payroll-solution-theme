          Juan built a 10-country payroll engine from the ground up, scaled it, and sold it to Intuit. 
          He spent another six years engineering Intuit's payroll product and met a whole team of 
          talented engineers who secretly shared the same dream: what if we could rebuild payroll 
          infrastructure to make it easier and faster?
        </p>
        <p>
          Juan wanted to create the best rails for modern payroll and let every developer build on 
          top of it. So, they joined forces to start Salsa and bravely proclaimed to the world 
          "One day, payroll will be modern AND simple. And we'll help lead this change."
        </p>
        <p>
          Why the name Salsa? Because paying people doesn't have to be a complicated dance, it should 
          just be delicious and maybe a little spicy. And having a great name helped convince all 
          of their favorite engineers to join the journey.
        </p>
        <p class="font-medium">
          From the team that brought you QuickBooks Payroll, Gusto, and Xero, we're building the 
          infrastructure we wish we had when we started out.
